## Usage

Once the plugin is enabled, it will automatically collapse all child folders when you collapse a parent folder. You don't need to do anything else!

The plugin offers the following features, configured in **Settings → Auto Folder Collapse**.

| Feature | Default | What it does |
| ------- | ------- | ------------ |
| **Auto collapse after inactivity** | **300 seconds** | After this many seconds of inactivity, every open folder is collapsed. Set the slider to 0 to disable. |
| **Auto-collapse children on parent collapse** | **Always on** | When you collapse a folder, every sub-folder inside it is collapsed too (original behaviour). |
| **Exclusive accordion** | **Off** | When you expand a folder, all other folders that are not its ancestors or descendants are automatically collapsed. This keeps the sidebar focused on the area you’re working in. |
| **Immune folders** | **None** | Folders that always stay collapsed or always stay expanded, regardless of the active file. |

### Immune folders

Immune folders ignore the automatic collapse behavior. Add a folder to **Always collapsed** to keep it collapsed even when a file inside it is open. Add a folder to **Always expanded** to keep it expanded no matter which file is open or how long you are inactive.

Every parent folder of an added folder inherits the behavior: adding one folder covers its whole subtree of ancestors.

Enable or disable either feature at any time; the change takes effect immediately.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the plugin, try the following steps:

1. Ensure you are using the minimum required version of Obsidian (`0.12.0`).
2. Disable and re-enable the plugin in the Obsidian settings.
3. Restart Obsidian.
